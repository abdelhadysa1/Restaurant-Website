# Restaurant-Website

## About Adare

I was inspired by Daniel Walter Scott's virtual Adare Restaurant website idea. I had a look at his wireframes, initial structure, and the filler text that he provided and used them as the base.

The initial version of this project was similar to Daniel's. I extended the original idea by adding the following:
- Changing fonts and page structure
- Adding the 'Make Reservation' button
- Adding mobile navigation with a hamburger icon
- Adding animations and transition effects
- Adding a vignette effect to the background
- Making the website responsive on mobile devices, tablets, and laptops

This project is coded with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
